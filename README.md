# project-beta
"Using Valve assets from the video game Portal made in 2006 and maps/storyline from 2006, The Project-Beta team present a modification to Portal that allows players to play Portal 1 as it was in Late 2006, using a developer build from Valve to piece together the storyline, present Portal: Project-Beta."

# What you have to do before playing

Due to Github's... questionable policies regarding file size, 2 files had to be put into a 7z file.

You have to go to `\project-beta\materials\models\portals`

and unzip `orange_swirl.7z` and `blue_swirl.7z` to the same folder
